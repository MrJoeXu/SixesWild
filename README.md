# SixesWild
----------------------------------------
This is an interesting game of numbers. The goal of the game is to connect tiles whose numbers add to 6. 

##How to run Sixes Wild Game:

+ Open SixesWild/src.sixeswildgameview/SixesWildWindow.java; 
+ Run as a Java Application.


##How to run Sixes Wild Level Builder:

+ Open SixesWild.src.levelbuilderview/LevelBuilderWindow.java; 
+ Run as a Java Application.


##How to run Test Coverage:
+ Right click the SixesWild/Test Folder
+ Select Coverage As -> JUNIT Test

##Notes:
Level Builder allows for enabling and disabling tiles, and setting bonus frequency
to low, medium, or high.  However, all enabled tile values will appear with the same frequency,
and you are unable to set the exact percentage chance they appear..
